        <h1>All about Volleyball!</h1>
        <h2>What is Volleyball?</h2>
        <p>Volleyball is a team sport that was first played in 1895 in Holyoke, Massachusetts, United States. In volleyball, there are 2 teams that are separated by a net in the middle of the court. Each team tries to score points by <strong>grounding</strong> a ball on the other team's court.<p>

    <h2>Equipment</h2>
    <p> In volleyall, there isn't a lot of equipment needed. All you need is a volleyball, a net, and proper shoes to play in. If you dive a lot in volleyball, I recommend getting knee and shoulder pads so you don't hurt yourself in a game!</p>
